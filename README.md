# Data-Science_Projects
Data Science Projects I am working on to gain a better understanding of different concepts. 
I am trying to expose myself to areas of data science such as:
-cleaning data (removing empty columns, following specified criteria, increasing the readability of data, etc.)
-analyzing data (how data can tell a story)
-using and understanding data visualization (using matplotlib and pandas)
-SQL(SQLite, PostgreSQL, creating databases, etc.)
-understanding the importance of probability and statistics 
-Machine learning concepts
